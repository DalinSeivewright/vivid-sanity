# Skeleton SprintBoot + Angular Project

* Note:  Still a WIP and tailored for my own use really

## What is this for?
When I want to start up a project, even something to mess around with, 
it takes awhile to actually set everything up.  With this skeleton project I'll be able to spin up projects
quicker that have the base libraries I need.

## What is included?
* SpringBoot 2
  * Zuul
  * Lombok
  * Web Starter
* Angular

## Use
* Clone this repo
* Run X to create a new project based off of the sketelon (TODO) 
* gradlew assemble to generate a JAR containing the Java code and Angular app for deployment

## TODO
* Need a script to rename things to create a new project.
  * rootProject.name in settings.gradle
  * java package structure
  * project folders
  * Main Application.java file
  * Everything else should auto configure from rootProject.name
* Configure Zuul for API proxy
